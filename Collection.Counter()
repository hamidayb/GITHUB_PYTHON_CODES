Explanation

Customer 1: Purchased size 6 shoe for $55.
Customer 2: Purchased size 6 shoe for $45.
Customer 3: Size 6 no longer available, so no purchase.
Customer 4: Purchased size 4 shoe for $40.
Customer 5: Purchased size 18 shoe for $60.
Customer 6: Size 10 not available, so no purchase.

Total money earned =  55 + 45 + 40 + 60 = $200

no_of_customers = int(input())
for i in range(x):
    pairs_of_sale = list(map(int,input().split()))
    if((pairs_of_sale[0] in shoes.keys()) and (shoes[pairs_of_sale[0]] != 0)):
        shoes[c[0]] -= - 1
        amount += pairs_of_sale[1]
