Explanation 0

Given list is [2,3,6,6,5]. The maximum score is 8, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.



CODE FOR THE PROBLEM:

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
b = False
if(n==len(arr) and n>=2 and n<=10):
    for i in arr:
        if(i>=-100 and i<=100):
            b = True
    if(b==True):
        maxv = max(arr)
        arr = list(filter(lambda x:x!=maxv,arr))
        print(max(arr))
